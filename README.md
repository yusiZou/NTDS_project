This repository contains all the work for the Network Tour of Data Science project during year 2018-2019 at EPFL. 
More information about this course can be find [here](https://github.com/mdeff/ntds_2018/tree/master/projects#terrorist-attacks-and-relations).
The Dataset used in this Project is the [Terrorist Attacks Dataset](https://linqs-data.soe.ucsc.edu/public/lbc/TerrorAttack.tgz).

# Structure of the Project

This Project is divided in three parts :

## Data Acquisition

In this part we familiarize ourselves with the raw data from the dataset.

## Data Exploration

Here we explore the data in more depth and try to extract meaningful informations from it.

## Data Exploitation

Finally we try to use the knowledge extracted from the data to use it in a useful way. Here we will train a Machine Model in order to predict the organization standing behind an attack.
